/**
 * This sheet is very similar to how we left off, but I've added a few sections and
 * rearranged others. Naming should all be consistent unless I indicate with comments
 * in the HTML file (which only happens in a couple of places). There shouldn't be too
 * many new properties here; most were ones we went over in class; a few exceptions:
 * 
 *    line-height       how tall each line of text should be (pixels, percent, etc)
 *    color             the color of TEXT
 *    font-family       what font text should appear in
 *    cursor            what happens to the mouse when it hovers over an element
 *    border-radius     rounded corners on an element
 *
 * If you need a refresher on what a property means or want to learn some new properties,
 * Mozilla's got a great source of everything there is to know.
 *
